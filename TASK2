I have always had a passion for chess, this project will help me combine it with my keen interest in robotics to create a fruitful learning experience in the summers.
I think it would be very cool experience playing against a computer which is physically present in front of you. I have seen similar bots on the internet and always wanted to create something similar.
i think it help me tackle new challenges as it domain i that i have not explored till my current involvement in the club. I have to gain a solid base on controlling a robotic limb. My past experience with the club 
has been very positive, i hope to extend my time at the club as a fresher through this project
